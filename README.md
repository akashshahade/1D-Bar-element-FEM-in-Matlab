# 1D-Bar-element-FEM-in-Matlab
This is a Matlab program to solve 1D bar element problem of FEM. The question is given along with. With some minor changes, the same code can be used for other 1D static problems also.

Q. Determine the nodal displacements at load point, strains, stress and reactions for 1D bar element subjected to an axial load of 100kN. E = 210 Gpa, A = 1000 mm2, L = 1000 mm.
